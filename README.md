# Bitterli's Media Player
This is a side project I started back around December of 2018 after seeing a tutorial page about playing sampled audio files in java. At the start of this school year, I decided that I would give myself the challenge of turning it into a graphically driven program with sliders and controls. Later, I decided to push myself further to see if audio effects like reverb and equalization can be added. Ultimately, it turned into a multimedia player.

## About
This project is just me messing around in Java to better understand GUI elements and external libraries.
This project was planned to be a showcase for my second semester of my advanced coding class in High School before the pandemic killed school.
This project resumes as something to mess around in and continue to better understand how GUIs work in Java.
