# Bitterli's Media Player
This is a side project I started back around December of 2018 after seeing a tutorial page about playing sampled audio files in java. At the start of this school year, I decided that I would give myself the challenge of turning it into a graphically driven program with sliders and controls. Later, I decided to push myself further to see if audio effects like reverb and equalization can be added. Untimately, it turned into a multimedia player.

## About
This is my 2019 - 2020 Advanced Coding school project for the second semester.
This project will be ongoing until April of 2020.

## Plans
- Have a media player similar to VLC media player but have more functionality.
- Have it as a stand alone executable jar.
- Incorporate multitrack audio mixing (single out individual audio channels in a surroundsound).
- Add more advanced audio effects (really just a form of reverb, speed/pitch control, equalizer).
- Have two versions, one with the vlcj library and one out of the default java library.

## Website
Go check out my website, it's not exactly java or coding related but...

and yes, I made my website in a notepad file. Odd flex but okay.
