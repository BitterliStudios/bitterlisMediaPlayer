## NOTE
This project is probably abandoned. Because of COVID-19, I wasn't able to finish this. It was my senior year school project but yeah... schools closed before this could be finished. I also can't seem to get it working again so I am just going to consider this thing abandoned. If anyone wants to use this code to make their own media player, feel free to. I don't remember where the bugs are but i'm sure someone could find some use for this code. Kind of a shame that this thing is abandoned.

I have started working on a new project, BitterliOS, which you can check out at https://github.com/BitterliStudios/BitterliOS.

# Bitterli's Media Player
This is a side project I started back around December of 2018 after seeing a tutorial page about playing sampled audio files in java. At the start of this school year, I decided that I would give myself the challenge of turning it into a graphically driven program with sliders and controls. Later, I decided to push myself further to see if audio effects like reverb and equalization can be added. Ultimately, it turned into a multimedia player.

## About
This project is just me messing around in Java to better understand GUI elements and external libraries.
This project was planned to be a showcase for my second semester of my advanced coding class in High School before the pandemic killed school.
This project resumes as something to mess around in and continue to better understand how GUIs work in Java.
