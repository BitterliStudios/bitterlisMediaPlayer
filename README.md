# Bitterli's Media Player
This is a side project I started back around December of 2018 after seeing a tutorial page about playing sampled audio files in java. At the start of this school year, I decided that I would give myself the challenge of turning it into a graphically driven program with sliders and controls. Later, I decided to push myself further to see if audio effects like reverb and equalization can be added. Ultimately, it turned into a multimedia player.

## About
